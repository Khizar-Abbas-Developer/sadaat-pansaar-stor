    description:
      "Brazil nuts are large, energy-dense seeds that come from the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), which grows primarily in the Amazon basin. The trees can grow up to 160 feet tall, making them one of the largest trees in the rainforest. The nuts themselves are encased in a hard, woody shell and are harvested sustainably to protect the natural environment.",
